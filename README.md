# mars-news-challenge

We're now ready to take on a full web-scraping and data analysis project. We learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. We've also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage. As I worked on this Challenge, I strengthened the same core skills that I have been developing until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating my insights. We primarily worked with a Mars News Site that has some datapoints that were gathered from every day operations on Mars. 

The data will need to be presented in two parts/deliverables:

1.) Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

2.) Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

All of the data was scraped from the following site: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html. 

You will find my code in the Starter_Code Folder, the material/code needed for the first deliverable will be located in part_1_mars_news.ipynb and the second deliverable will be located in part_2_mars_weather.ipynb respectively. In this folder you will also locate the .csv file that needed to be exported from the the second part of the challenge, that file is named mars_weather_df.csv. 

Please let me know if you have any questions!
